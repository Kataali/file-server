He's not an adult. He is a boy,

putting pressure on his trachea,

Hello. I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

I'm a surgical resident at San

describing a surgeon?

He's not Rain Man.

42
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,489
He's high-functioning. He's
capable of living on his own,

43
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,525
capable of managing
his own affairs.

44

our new hiring standard?

the definition of "president" while
you were skimming the dictionary?

50
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:14,511
You're hiring him to be a
surgical resident, my department,

00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,049

Marcus, stop making
everything so personal.

53
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,115
I made it personal?

54
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:23,248
You've wanted his job since day
one. Everyone in this room knows that.

55
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,189
And, Aaron, yes,
this is your hospital,

56
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:28,524
but the money it takes to run it
comes from the foundation I control,

nice, shall we?

that you're standing there.

any other candidate.

61

And you genuinely thought

62
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,039
that his board wouldn't
reasonably have any doubts

63

about hiring a surgeon who's
been diagnosed with autism?

64
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,104
So justify your decision.

65
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,211
I met Shaun Murphy
when he was 14 years old.

66
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,357
I was living in Wyoming at
the time. He was, and he still is,

67
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,518

68
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:03,360
Yes, he has autism, but he
also has savant syndrome,

69
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:08,068
genius-level skills in several
areas. He has almost perfect recall.

70
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:13,232
He has spatial intelligence, and
he sees things and analyzes things

71
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,537
in ways that are
just remarkable,

72
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,807

even begin to understand.

him since he was 14.

Especially those who don't have
the same advantages that we have.

340
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:52,470
We hire Shaun, and we give
hope to those people with limitations

341
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:55,508
that those limitations are
not what they think they are.

342
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,543
That they do have a shot.

343
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:07,443
We hire Shaun, and we
make this hospital better for it.

344
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,921
We hire Shaun, and we
are better people for it.

345
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:14,557
We'd be better people

346
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,829
spending a lot more on
malpractice insurance.

347
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:21,977
DR. MELENDEZ: How
old is this kid again?

348
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,060
JARED: Eight.

349
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:24,997
DR. MELENDEZ: Sponge stick.

350
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,744
What was his heart
rate five minutes ago?

351
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,239
JARED: Eighty-six.

352
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:36,373
You sure?

353
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,679
JARED: Certain. He's been
a rock. It's barely changed.

354
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,851
DR. MELENDEZ: No, something's
changed. Something's different.

355
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:48,803
You asked earlier about an
echo? You had no medical reason,

356
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,090
but you asked anyway. Why?

357
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,125
CLAIRE: There was this weird guy,
the one that did the one-way valve.

358
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,033
He kept insisting that the boy
needed an echocardiogram.

359
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:59,772
- DR. MELENDEZ: He didn't say why?
- He was really weird.

360
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:01,398
(RAPID BEEPING)

361
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,908
CLAIRE: His blood pressure's
dropping. That makes no sense.

362
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:06,502
He's not bleeding anymore.
Everything's under control.

363
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:08,605
DR. MELENDEZ: Do an echo.

364
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:11,082
JARED: Sir, the boy's wide
open. It's gonna take a while.

365
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,245
Good. That'll give me time to figure
out why the hell we're doing an echo.

366
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,964
Dr. Browne, you're with
me. We're gonna go find

367
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:17,388
your weird guy. Keep him stable.

368
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,217
Why the echo?

369
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:30,894
Okay. The... The...
Okay. The... I...

370
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,101
Okay. I understand you think
he needs an echocardiogram.

371
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:36,301
We just don't know why.

372
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:41,080
Well, I noticed that there was
a slight reduction in the intensity

373
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,637
of the electrocardiogram.

374
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:44,843
The electrical flow?
I noticed that, too.

375
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,510
The heart rate was the same
but the amplitude dropped.

376
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,844
Pericardial effusion.

377
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,181
Reduced cardiac output.

378
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,518
Would stress other organs.

379
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:52,989
Causing them to shut down.

380
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,082
Yes.

381
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,896
Hold on. Yeah. We're
coming right back up.

382
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,027
Thank you.

383
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:06,095
They did the echo. It's
normal. No pericardial effusion.

384
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,766
No, it has to be. There
is no other explanation.

385
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:12,005
The echo is normal, which
means we just wasted our time.

386
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,536
No.

387
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,551
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

388
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,921
Okay. Hey. Come
with me. Come on.

00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,299
Show them.

390
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:54,810
Again.

391
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:00,649
Again.

392
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,386
Again.

393
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,754
There.

394
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:07,895
Looks normal to me.

395
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:12,068
It's not normal. There's a concave
deformity in the right atrium.

396
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,069
No, there's not.

397
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,272
Yes, there is. It's very subtle.

398
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,866
Even if you are
right, that's not

399
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,809
where a pericardial
effusion manifests.

400
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:27,242
Not usually. But it could.

401
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:32,483
This kid was sprayed with
glass shards. Cut his jugular.

402
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,457
What if a piece of glass
entered his bloodstream?

403
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,860
It could have traveled
down the jugular vein

404
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,867
into the brachiocephalic vein
and onto the superior vena cava.

405
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:45,569
If it punctured the SVC, a block
could be leaking behind the heart,

406
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:48,573
restricting the heart's ability to
expand and fill during diastole,

407
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,165
reducing the heart's efficiency.

408
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,601
Lot of ifs there.

409
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:58,673
Dr. Chen,

410
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,884
prepare a 14-gauge
on the syringe.

411
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:09,921
All in favor of ratifying
Dr. Glassman's decision in hiring

412
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:11,327
Dr. Shaun Murphy?

413
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,166
All against?

414
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,164
Excuse me.

415
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,936
- Is this a medical emergency?
- No, no medical emergency.

416
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,221
Then you weren't
supposed to interrupt...

417
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:28,146
Yes, I know, but
you need to go online.

418
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,237
What? What site?

419
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,213
Pretty much any of them. Twitter,
YouTube, any local news site.

has over 200,000 views.

00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,030
Apparently, he's
one of our doctors.

Dr. Shaun Murphy saved this boy.

424
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:58,608
The boy is in OR-2. Dr. Melendez
isn't sure if he's going to make it.

Your fiancé sure
can handle a knife.

respecting Dr. Andrews?

No.

Why not?

435

Yeah.

Why were you rude to
me when we first met,

494
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:09,213
then nicer to me the
second time we met,

495
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:11,273
and now you want
to be my friend?

496

you were pretending?

00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,783
Shaun, we're ready.

498
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,330
The vote was clear. Why
are we reopening this?

499
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,201
Is it really because
of a piece of publicity?

500
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,536
It's because the man
just saved somebody's life.

501
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:36,666
And thank God for that,

502
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,619
but it doesn't change a
single thing we discussed.

503
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,003
DR. GLASSMAN:
Give him six months.

504
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:43,342
If he proves anything
less than excellent...

505
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,680
Someone less than excellent
means someone else dies.

506
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,514
Well, I would love to
make you happy, Doctor.

507
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,819
I would love to hire someone

Unfortunately, God
already has a job.

rest of us will have.

00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:03,863
You won't be the one
who pays the price.

514
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:13,878
If Shaun doesn't live up to
everything I know he can do,

515
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,846
he will be immediately released,

516
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,718
and I will resign my position
as president of this hospital.

517
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,186
We haven't heard
from Dr. Murphy yet.

518
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:29,953
Perhaps we should hear from
him before we decide his fate.

519
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:32,523
DR. GLASSMAN: Shaun.

520
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:54,081
Dr. Murphy, I'd
like you to tell us

521
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,814
why you want to
become a surgeon.

522
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:16,333
SHAUN: Why do I want
them to be my friends?

523
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:17,928
STEVE: Everybody
needs friends, Shaun.

524
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:21,604
It's gonna be cool, okay?
Play hide-and-seek, maybe?

525
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,847
- Okay.
- Tag in the warehouse.

526
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:30,947
(KIDS CHATTERING)

527
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,218
I told you, it's fun, right?

528
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,315
(SHUSHES)

529
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,266
Hey. You know what?

530
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:17,897
(SCREAMS)

531
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,739
(THUDDING)

532
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,997
The day that the rain
smelled like ice cream,

533
00:37:57,075 --> 00:38:01,638
my bunny went to
heaven in front of my eyes.

534
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,417
The day that the copper
pipes in the old building

535
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:09,749
smelled like burnt food,

536
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:13,882
my brother

537
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:18,990
went to heaven
in front of my eyes.

538
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:26,736
I couldn't save them. It's sad.

539
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,605
Neither one had the
chance to become an adult.

540
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:37,873
They should have become adults.

541
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:44,154
They should have had
children of their own

542
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:47,124
and loved those children.

543
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:55,931
And I want to make that
possible for other people.

544
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:10,707
And I want to make a lot of money
so that I can have a television.

545
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,723
Dr. Murphy,

546
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:30,894
I want to be the
first to welcome you

547
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:33,404
to San Jose Saint
Bonaventure Hospital.

548
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:38,475
We're very proud to have you.

549
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:41,904
(PEOPLE CLAPPING)

550
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,587
DR. GLASSMAN: Shaun,

551
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:53,124
Dr. Melendez's team
is going into surgery.

552
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,091
I mean, if you're interested.

553
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,714
DR. MELENDEZ:
Got a messy field here.

554
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:03,017
Murphy.

555
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:12,996
SHAUN: Suction.

556
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:22,513
Never forget,
you're the smart one.

557
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:24,377
You can do anything.

558
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:27,113
And I'm proud of you, Shaun.

559
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:36,339
DR. MELENDEZ: Thought
you've seen many of these.

560
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,387
I remember my first.

561
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:44,293
I kept thinking, "It doesn't
get any better than this."

562
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,702
But for you, I'm afraid,
that's literally true.

563
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,804
You're a nice kid, and
you're obviously very smart,

564
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:56,946
but you don't belong here.

565
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:00,214
So, as long as you're
part of my team,

566
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:03,152
this is all you're ever
going to be doing, suction.

567
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,994
SHAUN: I saw a lot of
surgeons in medical school.

568
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:14,623
You're much better than them.

569
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,557
I have a lot to learn from you.

570
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,306
You're very arrogant.

571
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:29,407
Do you think that helps
you be a good surgeon?

572
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:32,943
Does it hurt you as a person?

573
00:42:35,153 --> 00:42:36,587
Is it worth it?

574
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:48,931
